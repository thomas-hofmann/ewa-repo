			// 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
			// 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

			// These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
			// 1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
			// 2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
			// 3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
